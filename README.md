nfEngine
========

The main purpose of this project is to create an open-source, multi-platform, efficient and universal 3D game engine. At the moment the engine is in early development state and is fully buildable on Windows platform only (with Direct3D 11 renderer). Detailed list of features can be found in a section below.

    * **Renderers** - directory containing low-level renderer backends and related stuff
        * **RendererInterface** - set of headers defining low-level renderer API
        * **Shaders** - set of common shaders used by each renderer implementation
        * **nfRendererD3D11** - Direct3D 11 implementation
    * **nfRendererDemo** - demo application used for renderers testing

* **ShaderCache** and **ShaderCache_Debug** - compiled shaders

Dependencies
------------

The engine is dependent on following libraries:

- [AntTweakBar](http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/) - simple, temporary GUI
- [Bullet Physics Library](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) - physics engine
- [FreeType](http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/) - fonts rendering
- [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) - PNG files decoding
- [jpgd](https://code.google.com/p/jpgd/) - JPEG decoding
- [RapidXml](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) - XML parsing
- [rapidjson](https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/) - JSON parsing
- [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) - libpng and FreeType dependency, will be used to compress/decompress files in the future
- [model_obj](http://www.dhpoware.com/demos/glObjViewer.html) - OBJ model files parsing
- [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) - unit tests framework


Building the project - Windows
------------------------------

To make the code compileable, the following requirements have to be met:

1. Installed Visual Studio 2013.
2. Installed DirectX SDK.
3. Pulled external dependencies from [here](http://www.github.com/nfprojects/nfenginedeps)
    * **"nfEngineDeps"** directory will be created by using git submodules inside repo - fetch its contents by using `git submodule init && git submodule update` command
    * **NOTE:** Dependencies need to be built separately from engine. See README.md inside nfEngineDeps repo for more info.
4. Downloaded resources from [here](http://drive.google.com/open?id=0B66mya2agFOEd0RJUWx1aDZ6Ym8)
    * **"Data"** directory created in **"nfEngineTest"** with content copied from subfolder **nfEngineTestData**
    * **NOTE:** it is convenient to use Google Drive application to synchronize resources automatically (by adding this folder to your drive) and create symbolic link to them.

Example Batch code on Windows:

```
cd nfengine/nfEngineTest // go to root of repository
mklink /J Data "path-to-nfEngineTestData"
```

Building the project - Linux
----------------------------

For now, the only compileable part of nfEngine is nfCommon library and its tests binary, nfCommonTest. Requirements:

1. Installed GCC 4.9.2 or higher
2. Installed CMake 2.6 or higher
3. Pulled external dependencies from [here](http://www.github.com/nfprojects/nfenginedeps)
    * **"nfEngineDeps"** directory will be created by using git submodules inside repo - fetch its contents by using `git submodule init && git submodule update`
    * **NOTE:** Dependencies need to be built separately from engine. See README.md inside nfEngineDeps repo for more info.

To rebuild the entire project in one go, _Scripts/rebuild-all.sh_ script is available, which works similarly to "Batch Build" feature in Visual Studio. The script will call cleaning script and build the engine in all configurations possible. Similarly to Windows platform, Linux version of nfEngine can be built on two platforms - 32-bit (called **i386**) and 64-bit (called **x86_64**). Keep in mind, that building on i386 platform might require downloading 32-bit versions of standard libraries and compiler libraries to link against:

* On Fedora:
```
sudo yum install glibc-devel.i686 gcc-c++.i686
```

* On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
```

Building without _Scripts/rebuild-all.sh_ script is done by explicitly calling CMake and Make. To build nfEngine with default settings (Release build, 64-bit platform), simply call on nfEngine repo root directory:

```
cmake .
make
```

CMake can be called only once, unless there is a need to recreate Makefiles, or to change build type/platform.

Changing build settings is done by defining two CMake variables (both are optional - omitting one of them will use default setting mentioned above):
* **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE** - specifies build type. Possible values: **Release**, **Debug**. Building nfEngine with **Debug** build type will turn off compiler optimization and generate debugging information for GDB.
* **CMAKE_BUILD_PLATFORM** - specifies build platform. Possible values: **i386**, **x86_64**.

Example - forcing 64-bit build with Debug info:

```
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_PLATFORM=x86_64
make
```

Documentation
-------------

Doxygen documentation can be generated using "gen_doc.bat" script. Doxygen needs to be installed in the system and "doxygen" command must be visible in the shell.

Formatting
----------

Keep the code format consistent. Run format.bat/format.sh script to format the code automatically. ArtisticStyle (minimum version 2.05) needs to be installed in the system and "astyle" command must be visible in the shell.

ArtisticStyle can be downloaded [here](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/).

Basic coding guidelines:

* Code is written in [Allman style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style).
* We use spaces to indent parts of code. Each indentation takes 4 spaces. Mixed tabs and spaces are forbidden.
* To make code reviewing easier, keep max 100 chars per line. Exceptions to that rule might occur if it is absolutely necessary, depending on the situation (keep in mind, some legacy code in the repository might not follow this rule).
* Each source file should have a doxygen boilerplate which will briefly describe what this module does. This rule applies to header files as well.
* Use two newlines to separate chunks of code in one file (e.g. to split constants from function/method definitions, to split boilerplate from rest of the file, or to split namespaces).
* Naming rules:
    * **camelCase**, e.g.: ``int fontSize;``
    * **Begin with lower case:** local variables, public class members, function arguments.
    * **Begin with Upper case:** namespace names, class/structure/union/enum names, function/method names.
    * Add "m" prefix before private and protected class member names, e.g.: ``int mWidth;``.
    * Add "g" prefix before global variable names.
    * Write preprocessor macros using upper case only, e.g.: ``#define LOG_ERROR(x) ...``.
    * Don't use Hungarian notation!
* File naming rules:
    * Begin with upper case.
    * Use proper extension: *cpp* if it's C++ source file, *hpp* if it's C++ header, etc.
* Miscellaneous:
    * Write comments using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html) style.

Issue tracking
--------------

Working on nfEngine revolves around GitHub and its issue tracking system. You can find all current issues at [our GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nfprojects/nfengine/issues).

Usually issues are added by owners and categorized according with three labels:

1. **Type of issue:**
    * bug
    * enhancement
    * new feature
2. **Priority (how important is this issue for the project right now):**
    * low priority
    * medium priority
    * high priority
3. **Estimated complexity of the issue:**
    * small
    * medium
    * huge

Additional rules applied to labelling issues:

1. Issues labeled as **"new feature"** or **"enhancement"** label can additionally have a **"proposal"** label. Such issues are most probably not completely defined, might be a subject to change and should not be assigned to anyone until **"proposal"** label disappears. Removal of **"proposal"** will happen only after a discussion with project owners, or after completion of issue.
2. Issues labeled with **"bug"** label don't need to be tagged with estimate label if reporter cannot perform such estimation.

When a bug is found, it should be reported on issue tracking system with only **"bug"** label. Such issue should contain detailed information on how to reproduce the bug. After verification of the issue, one of the owners will further process the issue (either by prioritizing it and assigning it to someone, or by closing it if issue is invalid).

Issues crucial to project, usually related to one specific goal, are categorized into milestones. Milestones don't have specific due date. Issues not assigned to milestones are mostly general, small issues (most of these are probably bugs).

Workflow and branching
----------------------

nfEngine project contains two main long-running branches with code:

* **Branch "master"** - here is kept latest stable version of nfEngine, guaranteed to work. On this branch no new changes are committed - it should contain only merge commits with version change.
* **Branch "devel"** - this branch is main development branch used to contribute new changes.

Since the end of October, review of nfEngine commits is moved to GerritHub. All review should be done there - pull requests coming from GitHub will be automatically rejected.

Change will be merged only when it will pass code review and verification process, and when provided change will be mergeable to devel branch without conflicts. Before committing it is recommended to use pre-commit script hidden in Scripts directory, which will automatically run cppcheck, astyle and tests. As a point of reference, use this script on current top commit on devel branch - same results between run on remote branch devel and on change to be pushed will almost guarantee passed Verification process.

Changes to master branch are forbidden and will be rejected immediately by project owners.

Large changes (more than 500 lines affected) should be split in multiple commits to make review process easier.


Commit message format
---------------------

Commit messages should keep a simple, standard format. Title (first line of commit message) should describe briefly what change does. Then contributor should write more detailed description of committed change and way to verify provided change. Example commit message is provided below:

```
Fix memory leaks in nfCommon Math module

This commit fixes memory leaks which occurred when using NFE::Common::Vector. Leaks
occurred due to not freed memory in Vector destructor.

Verification:
Build, run tests using valgrind - no leaks should occur.
```

If needed, change can be split into multiple sub-changes. These changes should depend on each other and appropriate information should be provided in commit message with [PATCH x/y] tag.
