      "message": "We need to finally finish this issue. I did some background research, it looks like GlobalMemoryStatusEx is not a good direction for us.\n\nAs you know, we have problems with free paged memory. I looked onto MEMORYSTATUSEX structure reference, this is what I found:\n\"ullTotalPageFile:\nThe current committed memory limit for the system or the current process, whichever is smaller, in bytes. To get the system-wide committed memory limit, call GetPerformanceInfo\"\n\nThis might be the reason why for PCs with disabled page file we get incorrect values and tests fail. ullTotalPageFile has some other, lower value, not the one that we\u0027d expect. I suggest checking GetPerformanceInfo, even though it needs more calculation to be done because of page-count-to-kb translation, it might keep correct information. Please, do some research and tell me what came out. Since this is happening on my PC, I\u0027m ready to verify your patch before submitting if you send me one (not a patch-set, a .patch file generated by git-format-patch :) )",
