      "message": "(this comment refers to marked section, more to the right)\n\nI think this info is not the best information for reader. README.md is the first thing someone will read, this part of it is the first text someone reads about nfEngine. IMO we shouldn\u0027t attack such reader with \"what needs to be done\" information, especially when it is about API change. It just leaves a bad first impression and we increase our chances to be the only nfEngine developers ever. ;)\n\n\"The engine is in early development stage and many elements of it can be a subject to change.\" sounds much better for reader, more like a warning than a negative statement about our project. If someone needs info what needs to be done, Issue Tracker is at help. :)",
